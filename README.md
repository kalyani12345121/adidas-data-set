Sales Performance Analysis
Purpose: This focuses on evaluating how well Adidas products are selling over a specific period, in specific regions, or across different customer segments.

Key Metrics:

Revenue: The total money earned from product sales. It's often calculated as the sum of "Total Sale Value" for all transactions.
Units Sold: This is the total number of units sold, which gives an indication of the volume of products sold.
Average Sale Price (ASP): The average price at which a product is sold, calculated by dividing the total sales value by the quantity sold.
Theoretical Concepts:

Price Elasticity of Demand (PED): This theory measures how demand for a product changes with respect to changes in its price. In the context of Adidas, analyzing how price changes (e.g., through promotions or discounts) affect the quantity sold is crucial.

Seasonality: Many product sales show seasonal trends. In the case of Adidas, products like sportswear and footwear might sell more during certain months (e.g., back-to-school periods or holidays). Analyzing seasonal trends can guide marketing and inventory decisions.

2. Customer Segmentation and Behavior
Purpose: To divide customers into different segments based on demographics, purchasing behavior, or other factors and tailor marketing efforts accordingly.

# Key Metrics:

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): This metric helps predict the total revenue a customer will generate throughout their relationship with Adidas. It considers factors such as frequency of purchase, purchase volume, and average order value.

Repeat Purchase Rate: The percentage of customers who make more than one purchase over a given period. This is crucial for understanding customer loyalty.
Theoretical Concepts:

Market Segmentation: Dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. In sales data analysis, Adidas could use segmentation by region, income, or behavior.

Consumer Behavior Theory: Examines how customers make purchasing decisions and how they respond to marketing efforts. This theory could help Adidas analyze why certain products sell better and identify patterns based on customer demographics.

3. Discount and Pricing Strategy
Purpose: To determine the impact of pricing strategies (including discounts, promotions, and seasonal pricing) on sales performance.

# Key Metrics:

Average Discount: The average discount applied to products, which can be calculated by looking at the discount percentage.

Gross Margin: The difference between sales revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS), divided by sales revenue. This indicates the profitability of Adidas products before operating expenses are deducted.

Theoretical Concepts:

Discount Effectiveness: Understanding the relationship between discounts and sales volume is critical. Too many discounts might erode profitability, while too few might lead to lost sales opportunities.

Dynamic Pricing: This pricing strategy adjusts prices based on demand, competition, or other factors in real-time. Adidas could use this strategy to adjust prices based on trends and sales performance.

# Sales Forecasting

Purpose: To predict future sales based on historical data, helping Adidas optimize inventory management, marketing campaigns, and supply chain operations.

Sales Growth Rate: Measures the percentage increase or decrease in sales over time. This can be helpful for predicting future sales trends.

Forecasted Sales: Predicting future sales based on historical data using statistical models or machine learning.

# Theoretical Concepts:

Time Series Analysis:

A technique used to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). This can be used to forecast future sales based on past trends and patterns.

Moving Averages: A statistical method used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in data and highlight longer-term trends. This can help Adidas predict future sales by looking at trends in monthly or quarterly sales data.
